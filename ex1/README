ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
1. the program creates a dir named "welcome_dir_1", and then creates another dir named "welcome_dir_2" inside it.
2. it allocates 21000 bytes in the memory - it gets the inital address of the heap, and changes it current end-possition to be in a new address.
3. it creates an empty file named "welcome_file.txt" in the directory which was created ("welcoome_dir_2")
4. after that, it open the file "localtime" in the dir "etc" as a real only file. The file will be closed when another process will be activated.
5. it checks the status of the file (localtime).
6. it reads 4096 bytes from the "localtime" file and saves it in a buffer, and jumps 1506 bytes backwards, then it reads the
rest of the file, in total those commands reads the last 1506 bytes in the file, and closes the file.
7. the program reads the status of the "welcome_file", writes "welcome to OS-2023" in it and closes the file.\
8. the program deletes the file "welcome_file"
9. it tries to delete the dir "welcome_dir_2" but fails since this command only deletes files and not dirs
10. it deletes the dirs "welcome_dir_2" and then "welcome_dir_1"
11. exits all threads in the process (terminate everything).
SUM: the program opens 2 dirs with a text file inside, writes "welcome to OS-2023", and deletes what it created.
